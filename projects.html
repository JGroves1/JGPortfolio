                                <h5>FITS Phase</h5>
                                <p>I was a part of Unique Emporium’s journey when they were just starting. I created the
                                    existing logo per the owners’ specifications. As time passed, I knew in my heart that I could
                                    do better. Also, having been on the company’s website and briefly discussing it with one of
                                    the owners, I was aware of the site’s need for a refresh!</p>
                                <p>I reached out to one of the owners and offered my services! Shortly after, I sat down and
                                    had a long conversation with him about what direction to take things. I gathered inspiration
                                    into a moodboard, and I researched a few items I wanted to implement.</p>
                                <h5>SITS Phase</h5>
                                <p>I sketched my initial wireframes on paper and my initial logo ideas in Adobe Fresco. I took
                                    my wireframes to Adobe XD and shared my rough ideas with some peers. After those good
                                    conversations, I made some decisions and took the logo into Adobe Illustrator. I compiled the
                                    beginnings of a brand: logos, color palette, typefaces, and vibe. After I created some mockups
                                    of the website, I gathered more feedback from peers. I refined my mockups before finally
                                    diving into some code!</p>
                                <p>When I create a website, I follow the mobile-first approach, and I work page by page. Not
                                    much changed from my mockup 2.0 to the finished site. The Events page was the greatest
                                    challenge, so I made a practice CodePen to get the functionality down. Along the way, I did
                                    teach myself a few new JavaScript and CSS tricks.</p>
                                <p>When I look at the completed website, I am filled with pride. It was a long journey, and I
                                    made it! Seeing the website and “rebrand” through was important because I believed in myself.</p>
                                <h5>Results</h5>
                                <p>A stellar new logo and some brand guidelines. A fully-coded, 4-page website utilizing HTML,
                                    CSS, & JavaScript adhering to said guidelines. The website is fun, energetic, and filled with
                                    well-structured important information.</p>

                                <p>Unique Emporium is a trading card
                                    game (TCG) retail shop located in
                                    Saint Louis, MO. Opening their doors
                                    in the fall of 2022, owners Dave and
                                    Arif set out to build more than a TCG
                                    retail shop; they wanted to build a fun,

                                <p>As a young company, Unique Emporium
                                    lacks a strong, cohesive brand identity.
                                    The current company website is poorly
                                    designed and ineffectively structured. It
                                    was built with a do-it-yourself platform
                                    by someone who self-admits they did
                                    not know what they were doing and
                                    felt limited by the builder’s features.
                                    The website does not convey the fun,
                                    welcoming business Unique Emporium
                                    works hard to be.</p>

                                <p>Poké Mart reps told me they wanted to have a dark and light mode-compatible single-page
                                    website so customers could purchase all their top-sellers from each category. I started by
                                    seeking inspiration and creating a moodboard.</p>
                                <h5>SITS Phase</h5>
                                <p>Per typical Janessa, I began with some sketches on paper. I asked a few peers for feedback
                                    on my wireframe, then dove straight into the code: HTML, CSS, then JavaScript. As I worked
                                    on this webpage, I saved versions to refer back to. The biggest challenge here was JavaScript.
                                    I was still pretty new to it at the time.</p>
                                <h5>Results</h5>
                                <p>Poké Mart now has a fully coded web page for trainers to order their key items at any time of
                                    day or night, send in questions or comments, and even choose a dark or light mode.

                                    is a convenience store found strategically
                                    placed in every city in each of the nine
                                    Pokémon regions. Trainers can visit a
                                    Poké Mart to stock up on necessary
                                    supplies to support them on their journey
                                    to becoming Pokémon Masters. The exact

                                <p>Sometimes trainers just can’t make it to
                                    a physical Poké Mart store because they
                                    are too busy battling their Pokémon.
                                    Customers still need Poké balls, healing
                                    items, and evolution items even when
                                    they are on the go. Poké Mart wants to
                                    take their go-to stores online to allow
                                    these dedicated trainers a way to order

                                    conducted some research to fact-check myself and gain any new insights. I formed the
                                    questions much like the ones I already asked myself, and wrote the possible answers. Next
                                    I looked up inspiration and created a moodboard of ideas.</p>
                                <h5>SITS Phase</h5>
                                <p>It was time to get started, so I drew some pencil sketches of potential styles and layouts. I
                                    mapped the questions. Then I created a storyboard of all the landing screens I needed to create.
                                    I drew the organic shape backgrounds in Adobe Fresco and then imported them into Adobe XD. I
                                    then added the “buttons” and text, and I prototyped the connections. Then came testing and
                                    finishing touches.</p>
                                <h5>Results</h5>
                                <p>I had a functioning prototype of a very helpful migraine app. When I used it I knew that I was not
                                    skipping any questions that I need to consider when I’m getting a headache. Maybe one day I’ll
                                    develop it further and put it in the app store!</p>

                                <h5>Background</h5>
                                <p>Migraine is more than a headache; it’s
                                    a debilitating neurological disease.
                                    Managing triggers, symptoms, and
                                    various treatments can be an ever
                                    exhausting endeavor. I have suffered
                                    from this condition since I was a child.
                                    After all these years, each headache is
                                    still accompanied by the hope that it’s
                                    just a headache.</p>
                                <h5>Challenge</h5>
                                <p>I must act fast to determine which
                                    method of treatment I need to reduce
                                    the chances of the pain ruining my day.
                                    Each time I feel a bit of pain, I go
                                    through this same series of questions in
                                    my head. The problem with that is my
                                    head hurts, so I’m likely to forget some
                                    of the steps. I wanted to create an app
                                    that would make this mental pop quiz
                                    a little less stressful.</p>

                                    integration. One of the ways I wanted to do this was by focusing on their mobile application. I
                                    wrote a creative brief identifying my goal, target audience, tone, competitors, etc. I knew I
                                    wanted to demonstrate an added feature.</p>
                                <h5>SITS Phase</h5>
                                <p>I created a storyboard for my GIF. At first to just get a feel for what the animation would look like,
                                    but I made a second version with more details afterward. From my storyboards, I began working
                                    until I had 9 iterations and a final product.</p>

                            <p>Tracing its roots to 1873, B&N has
                                grown to be a consistent and reliable
                                leader in book sales. The book retailer
                                is  best known for its welcoming stores
                                offering a plethora of books and other
                                media as well as a Starbucks cafe.</p>
                            <p>In 1997, Barnes & Noble launched the
                                company’s eCommerce site. They
                                optimized their website for mobile
                                phones in May 2008, and due to its
                                success the company launched a new
                                mobile application in the summer of 2022.</p>
                            <h5>Challenge</h5>
                            <p>A thorough SWOT analysis identified an
                                overarching problem of B&N not
                                keeping up with the modern world.
                                The mobile application with a 2.2-star
                                rating on the app store contributed to
                                this issue. Most of the complaints about
                                the app are due to poor user experience.</p>
                            <p>A mobile app should be distinct from the
                                company’s mobile website and offer new
                                useful additional features to users. With
                                Barnes & Noble having a foot in both
                                brick-and-mortar and eCommerce, it
                                makes sense for the company’s mobile
                                application to integrate the two. At the
                                time of research, no competitor offered
                                this, so this opportunity gives B&N a
                                unique advantage.</p>

                                    and needed perfect squares. After completing my sketches, I jumped into Photoshop and
                                    got to work.</p>

                                cause is the student debt crisis in
                                America which impacts over 43 million
                                individuals.</p>
                            <h5>Challenge</h5>
                            <p>America has a combined $1.75 trillion
                                in student debt. Rising tuition costs,
                                stagnant wages, and complex loan
                                structures have created a systemic
                                problem that threatens individuals &
                                broader economic mobility. Many
                                people cannot afford their payments.
                                Financial strain delays marriage and
                                having a family. Some even miss out on
                                owning a reliable car or purchasing a
                                home. We need to leverage social media
                                to raise awareness, educate the public,
                                and push for policy reform.</p>
