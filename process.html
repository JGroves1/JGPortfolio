                        <h5>If I FITS, I SITS</h5>
                        <img src="images/JG-logo-animated.gif" alt="an animate gif of the JG logo cat inspecting a box and jumping in to sit" id="animatedLogo">
                        <p>In a recent breakthrough, one creative professional has crafted
                            a memorable acronym that encapsulates her creative process.
                            Her journey to "If I FITS, I SITS" involved meticulous planning,
                            extensive brainstorming, and careful consideration.</p>
                        <p>What began as a simple documentation of personal working
                            steps quickly evolved into an intensive, deep exploration of linguistic
                            creativity. The clever creator embarked on an exhaustive acronym
                            generation process, carefully evaluating possible combinations
                            that not only represented her workflow but could also align with her
                            personal brand identity.</p>
                        <p>Two frontrunners emerged from the extensive rounds of brainstorming:
                            "If I FITS, I SITS" and "UBE". One reflected her love for cats
                            and fit well with her brand logo, and the other represented her
                            Filipino heritage and was the name of her flagship brand color.</p>
                        <p>However, the creator was unwilling to settle for a catchy phrase
                            that didn't authentically represent her actual working process.
                            This commitment led to a rigorous evaluation period.</p>
                        <p>The selection process was collaborative and quite introspective. The
                            creator consulted her husband, adding an external perspective to
                            her personal deliberations. Multiple rounds of contemplation soon
                            followed, with each potential acronym scrutinized against the
                            actual steps of her creative workflow.</p>
                        <p>Ultimately, "IF I FITS, I SITS" was chosen &mdash; a true testament to the
                            creator's methodical approach and dedication to finding the most
                            perfect representational framework for her work process.</p>
                        <p>While the specific meaning of each letter remains personal to the
                            creator, the acronym stands as a unique marker of her commitment
                            to intentional and structured creativity.</p>

                        <h5>Fitting In It to Win It</h5>
                        <p>In the ever-evolving world of creative problem-solving, one innovative professional has developed a witty and
                            groundbreaking approach to project assessment inspired by an unlikely source: cat behavior. The "FITS"
                            portion of the methodology draws parallels to the internet-famous feline phenomenon of careful box selection,
                            transforming a quirky internet meme into a robust project evaluation framework.</p>
                        <p>Just as cats meticulously assess whether they can comfortably fit into a box before settling in, this creative
                            professional has developed a four-stage process for determining project viability. The FITS phase provides
                            a structured approach to understanding and selecting projects with surgical-like precision.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps most importantly, the "FITS" phase embraces the power of saying "no." Just as a cat will move on if
                            a box doesn't suit its various needs, this approach encourages the creator to be honest and recognize when a project might not be
                            quite the right fit. Each stage offers its own contributions to see if the creator "FITS" the job.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Frame</h5>
                        <p>The first stage, Frame, is all about problem identification. Here is where the creator either receives a task or
                            identifies a challenge that needs addressing. Or maybe someone comes to her with a problem she must
                            solve. This initial step is crucial, setting the foundation for everything that follows.</p>

                        <h5>Ideate</h5>
                        <p>Ideate comes next, this is where creativity knows no bounds. In this stage, ideas flow freely, with the creator
                            generating a comprehensive range of potential solutions. No concept is too wild, and no suggestion is too crazy
                            during this brainstorming phase.</p>

                        <h5>Target</h5>
                        <p>The Target stage represents a critical moment of refinement. Here, each of the various ideas is carefully
                            evaluated. Typically taking on a process of elimination, one standout solution emerges as the clear winner.
                            It's a process of strategic narrowing, much like a cat deciding whether a box is truly worth occupying.</p>

                        <h5>Shape</h5>
                        <p>Finally, the Shape stage brings research and inspiration into focus. Moodboards are crafted, references are
                            gathered, and the initial concept begins to take tangible form. This is when the project starts to gain substance
                            and direction. It is after shaping that the creator is truly ready to "SITS"!</p>

                        <h5>Sit Down and Create: The Art of<br>Transforming Concepts into Reality</h5>
                        <p>Continuing the innovative project methodology, the "SITS" phase represents the focused and action-oriented counterpart
                            to the contemplative "FITS" phase. This four-stage process turns carefully considered concepts into fully
                            realized creative projects. This phase of the project is all about building from the solid "FITS" foundation.</p>

                        <p>By emphasizing collaborative input, continuous refinement, and meaningful reflection, "SITS" offers the creator
                            a holistic approach to bringing ideas to life. It's more than a process&mdash; it's a mindset that transforms how she
                            thinks about creativity, productivity, and personal growth.</p>

                        <p>Unlike rigid methodologies that can stifle creativity, "SITS" embraces the natural ebb and flow of the creative
                            process. It acknowledges that true creation is not a linear path; one must cycle through iterations before she
                            can emerge victorious. Together, "FITS" and "SITS" are a truly comprehensive approach to problem-solving. This
                            clever acronym is a methodology that balances careful consideration with decisive action.</p>

                        <h5>Start</h5>
                        <p>The "SITS" journey begins with Start, a stage that emphasizes the importance of initial action. Typically, this involves
                            returning to basics: pencil and paper&mdash; where ideas first take physical form through rough sketches and some
                            rough preliminary designs.</p>

                        <h5>Iterate</h5>
                        <p>Iterate follows, introducing a collaborative element to the creative process. Whether through client feedback,
                            peer review, and/or consulting trusted confidants (often a supportive spouse), the creator ensures multiple
                            perspectives inform the project's development. Multiple saved versions provide a safety net, allowing for any
                            potential backtracking and exploration. Iterate represents the cycle of all the creating that takes place.</p>

                        <h5>Triumph</h5> 
                        <p>The Triumph stage illustrates the pinnacle of creative execution. Here, the creator's signature Perfectionist Mode™ is
                            fully activated, with meticulous attention to detail transforming the project from good to exceptional. Every tiny
                            finishing touch is carefully considered, and every element is refined.</p>

                        <h5>Summarize</h5>
                        <p>The final stage, Summarize, offers a moment of reflection and growth. Whether it's through introspection or outward
                            feedback, taking the time to acknowledge the culmination of the project is important. And it's not just about
                            celebrating the road to the completed project, or the project itself. It's about truly understanding the journey.
                            The creator takes time to acknowledge successes and identify areas for future improvement, turning each
                            project experience into a learning opportunity.</p>
